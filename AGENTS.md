# Agent Guidelines for LaTeX Project

This document outlines the guidelines for agents operating within this LaTeX project.

## Build Commands
*   `make all`: Compiles the main report (`midterm_report.pdf`).
*   `make example`: Compiles the example document (`example.pdf`).
*   `make twice`: Compiles the main report twice to ensure cross-references are correct.
*   `make rebuild`: Cleans all generated files and then recompiles the main report.

## Test Commands
There are no automated test commands. Verification involves visual inspection of the generated PDF documents.

## Code Style Guidelines
Adhere to consistent LaTeX formatting, clear document structure, and proper use of packages. Follow existing LaTeX conventions for document structure, command usage, and commenting.

## Cursor/Copilot Rules
No specific Cursor or Copilot rules were found in the repository.
